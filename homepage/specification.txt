HTML TAGS

On my home page, I used more than 10 different HTML tags. Some examples are:

- <html>, <head>, <title>, <meta> for the basic structure of the document.
- <nav>, <header>, <main>, <footer> to organize the layout of each page.
- <h1>, <h2>, <h3> for headings and section titles.
- <p> for text paragraphs.
- <ul>, <ol>, <li> for ordered and unordered lists (skills, projects, goals).
- <a> for navigation links in the navigation bar and buttons that link to other pages.
- <button> for the “Surprise Me” button.
- <form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea> for the contact form.
- <div> and <span> as generic containers to group and style content.
- <small> within the footer for the copyright notice.


CSS PROPERTIES

In styles.css, I used many different CSS properties to design the site. Among them:

- font-family to set the Montserrat font throughout the website.
- background and background-color to create the dark gradient and solid backgrounds.
- color to control the color of the text on the dark background.
- margin and padding to add spacing around and within elements.
- border and border-radius to style the cards and form fields.
- box-shadow to give depth to the cards.
- display and flex / flex-direction to create the page layout with a fixed footer.
- text-align to center the text in the main section and footer.
- letter-spacing and text-transform to style the section titles.
- transition to animate the hover effect on cards.

BOOTSTRAP

I used Bootstrap 4.5.3 to simplify the layout and responsive components:

- The navigation bar on all pages is based on the Bootstrap navigation bar, using classes such as
navbar, navbar-expand-lg, navbar-dark, and container.
- I used the grid system with the container, row, and col-md-* classes to align the
  “About Me” and “Projects” cards on the index page and structure the contact form.
- The buttons use Bootstrap button classes such as btn, btn-primary, and btn-lg.
- Spacing utilities such as mt-5, mb-4, py-5, and others help control vertical spacing.

JAVASCRIPT

I used JavaScript in script.js to add interactivity:

- On the home page, I listen for the DOMContentLoaded event and then select the
  “Surprise Me” button and the paragraph below it. When the user clicks the
  button, the script chooses a random piece of data from an array and dynamically updates the
  text in the paragraph.
- On the contact page, I attach a submit event listener to the contact form.
  Instead of reloading the page, the script prevents the default behavior,
  reads the name entered by the user, and displays a custom confirmation message
  in a separate paragraph. The form is then reset.
