This repository contains my completed solutions for the **2025 edition of Harvard’s CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science**.  
All problem sets (psets), labs, and weekly exercises from Week 0 to Week 9 appear here, written following best practices and CS50’s academic honesty guidelines.

The goal of this repository is to **document my progress**, show my **programming fundamentals**, and provide a clean structure of how I approached each challenge.
