sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:   Performace is very fast on sorted
                    input (exsits early), but grows dramatically
                    on random and reversed inputs, showing O(n^2) behavior.
                    #Can see time results on TIME.txt.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:   It is consistently the fastest across all input
                    orders, with similar times for sorted, random and
                    reversed and scales much better than quadratic,
                    consistent with O(n log n).
                    #Can see time results on TIME.txt.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:   Runtimes are similar regardless of input order but grow much
                    more than sort2 as n increases, wich aligns with Selection Sorts O(n^2)
                    and lack of best-case speedup.
                    #Can see time results on TIME.txt.
