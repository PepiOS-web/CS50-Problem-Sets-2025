If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Hypothesize about why the way you’ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Reflection: If the file songs.db contains the top 100 songs listened to by listeners in 2018,
their audio aura could be described based on the average values for energy, valence, and danceability.
For example, if most songs have high energy or danceability, their aura could appear lively, optimistic, and energetic.
If, on the other hand, the songs have low energy and low valence, this could indicate a calmer, more introspective, or melancholic mood.
Essentially, the combination of average values conveys a general impression of the emotional tone and rhythm that characterizes these listeners' musical tastes this year.
However, this method of calculating an “audio aura” is not very representative. Averaging only three numerical characteristics can oversimplify a person's musical identity.
A listener may like both sad and party songs equally, and the average would erase that contrast. Furthermore,
the data set ignores lyrics, context, listening frequency over time, and mood associations, all of which influence how people experience music.
Music is something so simple yet so complicated that it is difficult to analyze because the human factor of randomness comes into play.
A better approach would be to combine audio characteristics with natural language analysis of lyrics, listening habits over the course of the year, and genre preferences.
